// Write a small C snippet with int, if, while, return. Ask students: Which words are keywords? Which are 4 identifiers?
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
     int a;
     printf("enter the number");
     scanf("%d",&a);
     if (a>50)
     {
         printf("number is greater than 50");
     }
     while (a>50)
     {
         printf("\n%d",a);
         a=a-100;
     }
     return 0;
}
